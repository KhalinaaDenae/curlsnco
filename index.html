                    How do I prepare my hair for the appointment?
                </h5>
                <p class="faq-text">
                    Your hair must be dry and in its natural state before I cut it. Please come in with your hair cleansed, conditioned, detangled, and dry. Style it as you normally would but take care to avoid heavy oils and butters that leave a film on your hair and weigh it down.

Please DO NOT pull hair back in ponytails or clips, no twist outs, and no braids so the curls are not stretched out, and I can see them in their natural state and cut them properly.

                    On average, I recommend every 3-6 months.

You’re welcome and encouraged to come in as often as you’d like for treatments in between your cuts.

                    During your appointment, you will receive a one-on-one consultation prior to your service. During this time, we will thoroughly discuss your wants, needs, and goals for your hair. Everything done during the appointment is personalized – from the cut, to the product styling, to the recommendations. It’s all different according to the uniqueness of your curls!

You will be educated on how to maintain your hair at home, which is the most important tool you’ll walk away with! After every session, we want your curls to look great in and out of the salon!
